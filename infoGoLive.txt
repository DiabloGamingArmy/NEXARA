Q1: Yes. The SPA has a dedicated live setup view at public/pages/*/feed|login|admin|profile.html under #view-live-setup, opened via window.openGoLiveSetupPage() which calls navigateTo('live-setup') in public/scripts/app.js.
Q2: Per stream (createEphemeralChannel creates a fresh IVS channel per session); a persistent per-user channel initializer exists but the Go Live flow uses ephemeral channels.
Q3: Both—browser via the IVS Web Broadcast SDK and external encoders via RTMPS/OBS.
Q4: channelArn, playbackUrl, ingestEndpoint, rtmpsIngestUrl, streamKey, visibility, title/category/tags are saved in Firestore at liveStreams/{sessionId}; persistent channels (channelArn, streamKey, playbackUrl) live at users/{uid}/streamConfig/persistent.
Q5: Yes. createEphemeralChannel generates a sessionId (uuidv4) and stores it with the stream document in liveStreams/{sessionId}.
