Change Set 1 — “Fix view nesting so messages and videos render” (commit 875cbba)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose stated at the time: attempt to fix Messages/Videos content not rendering by changing Live Setup markup boundaries. This change set modified HTML structure, JavaScript wiring, and CSS across multiple pages.

### HTML edits (public/pages/*.html)
Files:
- public/pages/admin.html
- public/pages/feed.html
- public/pages/login.html
- public/pages/profile.html

Detailed structural changes applied across all four files:
1) **Live Setup container closure moved earlier**
   - The closing tags for the Live Setup container hierarchy were inserted **before** the Messages and Videos view sections.
   - This change was applied by moving or inserting closing `</div>` wrappers so that:
     - The Live Setup markup stopped enclosing `#view-messages` and `#view-videos`.
     - The Messages and Videos sections were intended to become top-level siblings to the Live Setup section rather than nested children.

2) **Messages and Videos view placement changed**
   - The `#view-messages` and `#view-videos` blocks were repositioned to follow immediately after the Live Setup section’s closing tags.
   - This introduced large multi-hunk edits with significant insertions and deletions due to DOM reordering.

3) **Markup duplication and reorder**
   - The diff indicated multiple large edits per file (several hunks), reflecting repeated reordering of HTML blocks, not just a single-line fix.
   - Some sections were removed and reinserted later in the file to ensure Messages/Videos appeared outside the Live Setup wrapper.

Net effect (as attempted): The Messages and Videos views were intended to be un-nested from the Live Setup container by explicit closure of the Live Setup DOM tree prior to those sections.

### JavaScript edits (public/scripts/GoLive.js)
File:
- public/scripts/GoLive.js

Detailed changes included:
1) **Added session cleanup hooks**
   - Introduced logic to clean up the live session on exit from the Live Setup view.
   - Added or modified functions to ensure the session was torn down when leaving the view.

2) **Added/modified external encoder/session provisioning helpers**
   - Added helpers intended to provision sessions without going live, and refactored some flow into helper functions.

3) **Additional logging/status wiring**
   - Extended and appended logging and status-related logic to support dock panels and external encoder display.

Net effect (as attempted): additional logic to create sessions without going live, track dock/encoder state, and cleanup on exit.

### JavaScript edits (public/scripts/app.js)
File:
- public/scripts/app.js

Detailed change:
1) **Navigation lifecycle hook change**
   - Added a new hook/handler to trigger cleanup when navigating away from the Live Setup view.

Net effect (as attempted): ensure live setup cleanup occurs on navigation away from that view.

### CSS edits (public/style.css)
File:
- public/style.css

Detailed changes:
1) **Go Live dock + layout CSS**
   - Added a set of dock-related class styles for layout, scroll, and visibility.
   - Introduced styling for dock tabs and panels.

2) **Additional layout adjustments**
   - Added or adjusted layout styles intended for the Live Setup view and its inner panels.

Net effect (as attempted): styling to support dock tabs/panels and layout adjustments.

Change Set 2 — Revert of the above change set (commit 34bba46)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose stated at the time: revert to the pre-change HTML/JS/CSS state because multiple pages broke and the request was to restore the original behavior.

This revert commit **fully reversed** the modifications from Change Set 1, with the following precise impacts:

### HTML reversions (public/pages/*.html)
Files:
- public/pages/admin.html
- public/pages/feed.html
- public/pages/login.html
- public/pages/profile.html

Reverted changes:
1) **Restored original Live Setup container boundaries**
   - Re-applied the original placement of Live Setup closing tags so that the DOM structure returned to its prior, known-good layout.

2) **Restored original Messages/Videos view placement**
   - Moved `#view-messages` and `#view-videos` sections back to their original locations in each file.

3) **Removed large HTML reorderings**
   - Deleted the reinserted and reordered chunks introduced in Change Set 1.

### JavaScript reversions
Files:
- public/scripts/GoLive.js
- public/scripts/app.js

Reverted changes:
1) **Removed new cleanup hooks**
   - Deleted the new session cleanup wiring added in Change Set 1.

2) **Removed new provisioning helpers**
   - Reverted the added helper functions and logic intended to prepare external encoder sessions.

3) **Removed added logging/status/dock wiring**
   - Reverted additions related to dock/encoder status tracking introduced in Change Set 1.

### CSS reversions
File:
- public/style.css

Reverted changes:
1) **Removed dock/layout additions**
   - Deleted the styles added for dock tabs/panels and layout adjustments.

Net effect: The codebase returned to the state immediately before Change Set 1.

Change Set 3 — This document (updateNotesDec22.txt)
---------------------------------------------------
Purpose: Provide a complete, precise accounting of changes made during this conversation, including reverted changes.

Change Set 4 — Re-adding missing View Containers (Fix for Blank Screens)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose: The revert in Change Set 2 seemingly removed the container divs for '#view-videos' and '#view-messages', causing the app navigation to show blank screens for those sections. This change restores them.

### HTML edits (public/pages/feed.html)
File:
- public/pages/feed.html

Detailed changes:
1) **Restored #view-videos container**
   - Added the video view container structure with header and content area.

2) **Restored #view-messages container**
   - Added the messages view container with sidebar for conversations and main chat area logic scaffolding.

3) **Restored #view-staff container**
   - Added the staff dashboard view container.

Net effect: Navigation to Videos, Messages, and Staff sections should now display the UI skeletons instead of a blank page.
